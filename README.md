# Metallic-Default-Detection
This program analyses the defects on the metallic surfaces using various Image Analysis techniques to predict the quality of metals provided.


All files can be found in a file titled Metallic Default Detection_Project_Final.zip.

The images used for refference are present in a file titled Refference Images_Defaults.zip as well as in Metallic Default Detection_Project_Final.zip which is available for downlaod.


Source Images - bmp  folder comtains the files containing images from defects on metal surfaces from 300 samples.


Ground truth - png folder contains images used for result comparison which are considered as optimum results of defects detected upon application of analysis techniques.This benchmark is used to compare our results obtained after processing the source images and obtain a score using various techniques.

Method_transform is our main function of method

Sc_image_best_method is the best method that have promising results for SC pictures
with all codes combined. This is the main code that explains everything detailed
all together.

Three methods are used for evaluating SC images:

Sc_image_1st_method & Sc_image_2nd_method are the code files where we tried other
methodology to come up with the results, they are also promising and can be improved
in future. We used this methods to show the main difference of the our best method
and others. 

Additionally an overview titled Metallic_Default_Detection_Summary.pdf  is added as attachment where we compare our end results for 
each method and comparison with ground truth and prepared table of the received results .

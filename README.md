# Metallic-Default-Detection
This program analyses the defects on the metallic surfaces using various Image Analysis techniques to predict the quality Courses attended of metals provided.






Method_transform is our main function of method

Sc_image_best_method is the best method that have promising results for SC pictures
with all codes combined. This is the main code that explains everything detailed
all together.
Sc_image_1st_method & Sc_image_2nd_method are the code files where we tried other
methodology to come up with the results, they are also promising and can be improved
in future. We used this methods to show the main difference of the our best method
and others. 

Additionally an overview titled Metallic_Default_Detection_Summary.pdf  is added as attachment where we compare our end results for 
each method and comparison with ground truth and prepared table of the received results .
